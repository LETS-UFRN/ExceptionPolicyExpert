# ExceptionPolicyExpert

The ExceptionPolicyExpert is a Eclipse plug-in that intends to help developers while they are programming, through making exception handling policy explicit, warning the developers about policy violations related to the code being implemented.

## What you need to use the plug-in
The plug-in needs to know the exception handling policy of you system. To do this, you need to add a XML file written in ECL language with the exception handling policy rules. This file needs to have the "contract.xml" name and should be in a folder called src-gen. Click [here](https://github.com/LETS-UFRN/SANER2018/blob/master/Case%20study/exception_handling_policy.xml) to see an exampple of ECL file definition.

## How to run

The plug-in is not published in Eclipse MarketPlace, so its necessary to download the project to you local files. 

### From Eclipse

You can run the Eclipse in a easy way direct by Eclipse:

1. Open the plug-in project with Eclipse
2. Right-button on project
3. Run as -> Eclipse Application
